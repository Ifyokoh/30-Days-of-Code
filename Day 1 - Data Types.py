# Task 
# Complete the code in the editor below. The variables i, d and s are already declared and initialized for you. You must:

# Declare 3 variables: one of type int, one of type double, and one of type String.
# Read 3 lines of input from stdin (according to the sequence given in the Input Format section below) and initialize your 3 variables.
# Use the + operator to perform the following operations: 
# Print the sum of i plus your int variable on a new line.
# Print the sum of d plus your double variable to a scale of one decimal place on a new line.
# Concatenate s with the string you read as input and print the result on a new line.


# Solution
# Declare second integer, double, and String variables.
new_i = int(input())
new_d = float(input())
new_s = input()
# Read and save an integer, double, and String to your variables.

# Print the sum of both integer variables on a new line.
print(i + new_i)
# Print the sum of the double variables on a new line.
print(d + new_d)
# Concatenate and print the String variables on a new line
print(s + new_s)
# The 's' variable above should be printed first.
